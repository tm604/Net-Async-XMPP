	New features:
	* Most of the public API methods now use Futures to indicate completion
	* SRV lookup - needs DNS although an optional constant allows getnameinfo
	lookups (these return servers that can't be contacted for gtalk, and do
	not account for priority/weighting)

	Bug fixes:
	* Don't include <show> element in initial presence notification.

	Documentation:
	* Initial documentation for some of the more useful public methods, thanks
